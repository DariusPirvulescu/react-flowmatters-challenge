##  Flowmatters Frontend Test
My attempt at solving the Frontend Test from Flowmatters.
This is a facebook page mockup built with React using the SASS (SCSS) preprocessor to compile into Cascading Style Sheets and bootstraped with *create-react-app*.

Was created with a mobile-first approach, having two views (Desktop & Mobile) with the *CSS breakpoint* at `768px`.

Some of the packages used:
- node-sass
- React-responsive
- material-ui [ core, icons, styles ]
- React-icons

[See live demo](https://flowmatters-frontend-test.netlify.app/)

### Scripts


After running `npm install` in the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.   

Server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
